I built myself a gravel bike last winter.

So I started speccing out an off-road capable bike following my usual preferences, steel frame, easy to maintain, no complicated gadgetary and don't worry about the weight.

* Frame: Kona Rove ST.
* Wheels: Hunt 650b Adventure Sport.
* Tyres: Clement Strada UST 42mm setup tubeless.
* Brakes / Shifters: TRP Hylex hydraulic disc brakes with a Gevanalle ratchet shifter mount.
* Drivetrain: Assorted Shimano bits giving a single 40 tooth front ring with an 11-40 11 speed cassette at the back.
* Assorted finishing kit and some stuff from my spare parts box.

Overall I'm pretty pleased with the result. The ride is relaxed
