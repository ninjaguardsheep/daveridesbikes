I blogged previously about my recent [gravel bike build](https://www.daveridesbikes.xyz/posts/2020-06-17-nbd.html).

The reason for building the bike up was to try more diverse routes and a different style of riding. So plans on hold thanks to 'rona, I've been picking out routes around my local area pulling in farm roads and bridleways.
